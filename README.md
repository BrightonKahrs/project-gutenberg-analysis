# Project Objective
This project is created to explore how Microsoft Fabric and Azure OpenAI can be used to analyze textual data. This project goal is to only leverage Fabric + AOAI to see how powerful using only these two architectural components can be for text based analysis. Microsoft Fabric offers the OneLake which means any type of data, including unstructured text, can be stored. The powerful combination of Microsoft Fabric and Azure OpenAI can unlock valuable insights in your text data like never before!

This project explores the following capabilities of Azure OpenAI, using Microsoft Fabric.
1. Entity Extraction
2. Text Summarization
3. Text Classification
4. Text Embeddings and Semantic Similarity

*This project should take about 1 hour to complete, follow the project steps below to get started*

# Prerequisites
1. An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) subscription
2. Contributor access to a [Microsoft Fabric workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/workspaces)
3. Access to a [Microsoft Fabric F64 capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/buy-subscription) or higher (The Fabric trial FT1 sku will not work). This capacity should be connected to your workspace.

*Note: an alternative approach is to leverage [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal)*
