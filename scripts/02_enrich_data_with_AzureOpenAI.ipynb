In substance these reasons were, first, that such publication\\nat any time during the existence of slavery might be used by the master\\nagainst the slave, and prevent the future escape of any who might adopt\\nthe same means that I did. The second reason was, if possible, still\\nmore binding to silence: the publication of details would certainly\\nhave put in peril the persons and property of those who assisted.\\nMurder itself was not more sternly and certainly punished in the State\\nof Maryland than that of aiding and abetting the escape of a slave.\\nMany colored men, for no other crime than that of giving aid to a\\nfugitive slave, have, like Charles T. Torrey, perished in prison. The\\nabolition of slavery in my native State and throughout the country, and\\nthe lapse of time, render the caution hitherto observed no longer\\nnecessary. But even since the abolition of slavery, I have sometimes\\nthought it well enough to baffle curiosity by saying that while slavery\\nexisted there were good reasons for not telling the manner of my\\nescape, and since slavery had ceased to exist, there was no reason for\\ntelling it. I shall now, however, cease to avail myself of this\\nformula, and, as far as I can, endeavor to satisfy this very natural\\ncuriosity. I should, perhaps, have yielded to that feeling sooner, had\\nthere been anything very heroic or thrilling in the incidents connected\\nwith my escape, for I am sorry to say I have nothing of that sort to\\ntell; and yet the courage that could risk betrayal and the bravery\\nwhich was ready to encounter death, if need be, in pursuit of freedom,\\nwere essential features in the undertaking. My success was due to\\naddress rather than courage, to good luck rather than bravery. My means\\nof escape were provided for me by the very men who were making laws to\\nhold and bind me more securely in slavery.\\n\\nIt was the custom in the State of Maryland to require the free colored\\npeople to have what were called free papers. These instruments they\\nwere required to renew very often, and by charging a fee for this\\nwriting, considerable sums from time to time were collected by the\\nState. In these papers the name, age, color, height, and form of the\\nfreeman were described, together with any scars or other marks upon his\\nperson which could assist in his identification. This device in some\\nmeasure defeated itself—since more than one man could be found to\\nanswer the same general description. Hence many slaves could escape by\\npersonating the owner of one set of papers; and this was often done as\\nfollows: A slave, nearly or sufficiently answering the description set\\nforth in the papers, would borrow or hire them till by means of them he\\ncould escape to a free State, and then, by mail or otherwise, would\\nreturn them to the owner. The operation was a hazardous one for the\\nlender as well as for the borrower. A failure on the part of the\\nfugitive to send back the papers would imperil his benefactor, and the\\ndiscovery of the papers in possession of the wrong man would imperil\\nboth the fugitive and his friend. It was, therefore, an act of supreme\\ntrust on the part of a freeman of color thus to put in jeopardy his own\\nliberty that another might be free. It was, however, not unfrequently\\nbravely done, and was seldom discovered. I was not so fortunate as to\\nresemble any of my free acquaintances sufficiently to answer the\\ndescription of their papers. But I had a friend—a sailor—who owned a\\nsailor’s protection, which answered somewhat the purpose of free\\npapers—describing his person, and certifying to the fact that he was a\\nfree American sailor. The instrument had at its head the American\\neagle, which gave it the appearance at once of an authorized document.\\nThis protection, when in my hands, did not describe its bearer very\\naccurately. Indeed, it called for a man much darker than myself, and\\nclose examination of it would have caused my arrest at the start.\\n\\nIn order to avoid this fatal scrutiny on the part of railroad\\nofficials, I arranged with Isaac Rolls, a Baltimore hackman, to bring\\nmy baggage to the Philadelphia train just on the moment of starting,\\nand jumped upon the car myself when the train was in motion. Had I gone\\ninto the station and offered to purchase a ticket, I should have been\\ninstantly and carefully examined, and undoubtedly arrested. In choosing\\nthis plan I considered the jostle of the train, and the natural haste\\nof the conductor, in a train crowded with passengers, and relied upon\\nmy skill and address in playing the sailor, as described in my\\nprotection, to do the rest. One element in my favor was the kind\\nfeeling which prevailed in Baltimore and other sea-ports at the time,\\ntoward “those who go down to the sea in ships.” “Free trade and\\nsailors’ rights” just then expressed the sentiment of the country. In\\nmy clothing I was rigged out in sailor style. I had on a red shirt and\\na tarpaulin hat, and a black cravat tied in sailor fashion carelessly\\nand loosely about my neck. My knowledge of ships and sailor’s talk came\\nmuch to my assistance, for I knew a ship from stem to stern, and from\\nkeelson to cross-trees, and could talk sailor like an “old salt.” I was'}, {'chunk_id': 1, 'content': 'well on the way to Havre de Grace before the conductor came into the\\nnegro car to collect tickets and examine the papers of his black\\npassengers. This was a critical moment in the drama. My whole future\\ndepended upon the decision of this conductor. Agitated though I was\\nwhile this ceremony was proceeding, still, externally, at least, I was\\napparently calm and self-possessed. He went on with his duty—examining\\nseveral colored passengers before reaching me. He was somewhat harsh in\\ntome and peremptory in manner until he reached me, when, strange\\nenough, and to my surprise and relief, his whole manner changed. Seeing\\nthat I did not readily produce my free papers, as the other colored\\npersons in the car had done, he said to me, in friendly contrast with\\nhis bearing toward the others:\\n\\n“I suppose you have your free papers?”\\n\\nTo which I answered:\\n\\n“No sir; I never carry my free papers to sea with me.”\\n\\n“But you have something to show that you are a freeman, haven’t you?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” I answered; “I have a paper with the American Eagle on it,\\nand that will carry me around the world.”\\n\\nWith this I drew from my deep sailor’s pocket my seaman’s protection,\\nas before described. The merest glance at the paper satisfied him, and\\nhe took my fare and went on about his business. This moment of time was\\none of the most anxious I ever experienced. Had the conductor looked\\nclosely at the paper, he could not have failed to discover that it\\ncalled for a very different-looking person from myself, and in that\\ncase it would have been his duty to arrest me on the instant, and send\\nme back to Baltimore from the first station. When he left me with the\\nassurance that I was all right, though much relieved, I realized that I\\nwas still in great danger: I was still in Maryland, and subject to\\narrest at any moment. I saw on the train several persons who would have\\nknown me in any other clothes, and I feared they might recognize me,\\neven in my sailor “rig,” and report me to the conductor, who would then\\nsubject me to a closer examination, which I knew well would be fatal to\\nme.\\n\\nThough I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt perhaps quite\\nas miserable as such a criminal. The train was moving at a very high\\nrate of speed for that epoch of railroad travel, but to my anxious mind\\nit was moving far too slowly. Minutes were hours, and hours were days\\nduring this part of my flight. After Maryland, I was to pass through\\nDelaware—another slave State, where slave-catchers generally awaited\\ntheir prey, for it was not in the interior of the State, but on its\\nborders, that these human hounds were most vigilant and active. The\\nborder lines between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for\\nthe fugitives. The heart of no fox or deer, with hungry hounds on his\\ntrail in full chase, could have beaten more anxiously or noisily than\\ndid mine from the time I left Baltimore till I reached Philadelphia.\\nThe passage of the Susquehanna River at Havre de Grace was at that time\\nmade by ferry-boat, on board of which I met a young colored man by the\\nname of Nichols, who came very near betraying me. He was a “hand” on\\nthe boat, but, instead of minding his business, he insisted upon\\nknowing me, and asking me dangerous questions as to where I was going,\\nwhen I was coming back, etc. I got away from my old and inconvenient\\nacquaintance as soon as I could decently do so, and went to another\\npart of the boat. Once across the river, I encountered a new danger.\\nOnly a few days before, I had been at work on a revenue cutter, in Mr.\\nPrice’s ship-yard in Baltimore, under the care of Captain McGowan. On\\nthe meeting at this point of the two trains, the one going south\\nstopped on the track just opposite to the one going north, and it so\\nhappened that this Captain McGowan sat at a window where he could see\\nme very distinctly, and would certainly have recognized me had he\\nlooked at me but for a second. Fortunately, in the hurry of the moment,\\nhe did not see me; and the trains soon passed each other on their\\nrespective ways. But this was not my only hair-breadth escape. A German\\nblacksmith whom I knew well was on the train with me, and looked at me\\nvery intently, as if he thought he had seen me somewhere before in his\\ntravels. I really believe he knew me, but had no heart to betray me. At\\nany rate, he saw me escaping and held his peace.\\n\\nThe last point of imminent danger, and the one I dreaded most, was\\nWilmington. Here we left the train and took the steam-boat for\\nPhiladelphia. In making the change here I again apprehended arrest, but\\nno one disturbed me, and I was soon on the broad and beautiful\\nDelaware, speeding away to the Quaker City. On reaching Philadelphia in\\nthe afternoon, I inquired of a colored man how I could get on to New\\nYork. He directed me to the William-street depot, and thither I went,\\ntaking the train that night. I reached New York Tuesday morning, having\\ncompleted the journey in less than twenty-four hours.\\n\\nMy free life began on the third of September, 1838. On the morning of\\nthe fourth of that month, after an anxious and most perilous but safe\\njourney, I found myself in the big city of New York, a _free man_—one\\nmore added to the mighty throng which, like the confused waves of the\\ntroubled sea, surged to and fro between the lofty walls of Broadway.\\nThough dazzled with the wonders which met me on every hand, my thoughts\\ncould not be much withdrawn from my strange situation. For the moment,\\nthe dreams of my youth and the hopes of my manhood were completely\\nfulfilled. The bonds that had held me to “old master” were broken. No\\nman now had a right to call me his slave or assert mastery over me. I\\nwas in the rough and tumble of an outdoor world, to take my chance with'}, {'chunk_id': 2, 'content': 'the rest of its busy number. I have often been asked how I felt when\\nfirst I found myself on free soil. There is scarcely anything in my\\nexperience about which I could not give a more satisfactory answer. A\\nnew world had opened upon me. If life is more than breath and the\\n“quick round of blood,” I lived more in that one day than in a year of\\nmy slave life. It was a time of joyous excitement which words can but\\ntamely describe. In a letter written to a friend soon after reaching\\nNew York, I said: “I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of\\nhungry lions.” Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be\\ndepicted; but gladness and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen\\nor pencil. During ten or fifteen years I had been, as it were, dragging\\na heavy chain which no strength of mine could break; I was not only a\\nslave, but a slave for life. I might become a husband, a father, an\\naged man, but through all, from birth to death, from the cradle to the\\ngrave, I had felt myself doomed. All efforts I had previously made to\\nsecure my freedom had not only failed, but had seemed only to rivet my\\nfetters the more firmly, and to render my escape more difficult.\\nBaffled, entangled, and discouraged, I had at times asked myself the\\nquestion, May not my condition after all be God’s work, and ordered for\\na wise purpose, and if so, Is not submission my duty? A contest had in\\nfact been going on in my mind for a long time, between the clear\\nconsciousness of right and the plausible make-shifts of theology and\\nsuperstition. The one held me an abject slave—a prisoner for life,\\npunished for some transgression in which I had no lot nor part; and the\\nother counseled me to manly endeavor to secure my freedom. This contest\\nwas now ended; my chains were broken, and the victory brought me\\nunspeakable joy.\\n\\nBut my gladness was short-lived, for I was not yet out of the reach and\\npower of the slave-holders. I soon found that New York was not quite so\\nfree or so safe a refuge as I had supposed, and a sense of loneliness\\nand insecurity again oppressed me most sadly. I chanced to meet on the\\nstreet, a few hours after my landing, a fugitive slave whom I had once\\nknown well in slavery. The information received from him alarmed me.\\nThe fugitive in question was known in Baltimore as “Allender’s Jake,”\\nbut in New York he wore the more respectable name of “William Dixon.”\\nJake, in law, was the property of Doctor Allender, and Tolly Allender,\\nthe son of the doctor, had once made an effort to recapture _Mr.\\nDixon_, but had failed for want of evidence to support his claim. Jake\\ntold me the circumstances of this attempt, and how narrowly he escaped\\nbeing sent back to slavery and torture. He told me that New York was\\nthen full of Southerners returning from the Northern watering-places;\\nthat the colored people of New York were not to be trusted; that there\\nwere hired men of my own color who would betray me for a few dollars;\\nthat there were hired men ever on the lookout for fugitives; that I\\nmust trust no man with my secret; that I must not think of going either\\nupon the wharves or into any colored boarding-house, for all such\\nplaces were closely watched; that he was himself unable to help me;\\nand, in fact, he seemed while speaking to me to fear lest I myself\\nmight be a spy and a betrayer. Under this apprehension, as I suppose,\\nhe showed signs of wishing to be rid of me, and with whitewash brush in\\nhand, in search of work, he soon disappeared.\\n\\nThis picture, given by poor “Jake,” of New York, was a damper to my\\nenthusiasm. My little store of money would soon be exhausted, and since\\nit would be unsafe for me to go on the wharves for work, and I had no\\nintroductions elsewhere, the prospect for me was far from cheerful. I\\nsaw the wisdom of keeping away from the ship-yards, for, if pursued, as\\nI felt certain I should be, Mr. Auld, my “master,” would naturally seek\\nme there among the calkers. Every door seemed closed against me. I was\\nin the midst of an ocean of my fellow-men, and yet a perfect stranger\\nto every one. I was without home, without acquaintance, without money,\\nwithout credit, without work, and without any definite knowledge as to\\nwhat course to take, or where to look for succor. In such an extremity,\\na man had something besides his new-born freedom to think of. While\\nwandering about the streets of New York, and lodging at least one night\\namong the barrels on one of the wharves, I was indeed free—from\\nslavery, but free from food and shelter as well. I kept my secret to\\nmyself as long as I could, but I was compelled at last to seek some one\\nwho would befriend me without taking advantage of my destitution to\\nbetray me. Such a person I found in a sailor named Stuart, a\\nwarm-hearted and generous fellow, who, from his humble home on Centre\\nstreet, saw me standing on the opposite sidewalk, near the Tombs\\nprison. As he approached me, I ventured a remark to him which at once\\nenlisted his interest in me. He took me to his home to spend the night,\\nand in the morning went with me to Mr. David Ruggles, the secretary of\\nthe New York Vigilance Committee, a co-worker with Isaac T. Hopper,\\nLewis and Arthur Tappan, Theodore S. Wright, Samuel Cornish, Thomas\\nDowning, Philip A. Bell, and other true men of their time. All these\\n(save Mr. Bell, who still lives, and is editor and publisher of a paper\\ncalled the “Elevator,” in San Francisco) have finished their work on\\nearth. Once in the hands of these brave and wise men, I felt\\ncomparatively safe. With Mr. Ruggles, on the corner of Lispenard and\\nChurch streets, I was hidden several days, during which time my\\nintended wife came on from Baltimore at my call, to share the burdens'}, {'chunk_id': 3, 'content': 'of life with me. She was a free woman, and came at once on getting the\\ngood news of my safety. We were married by Rev. J. W. C. Pennington,\\nthen a well-known and respected Presbyterian minister. I had no money\\nwith which to pay the marriage fee, but he seemed well pleased with our\\nthanks.\\n\\nMr. Ruggles was the first officer on the “Underground Railroad” whom I\\nmet after coming North, and was, indeed, the only one with whom I had\\nanything to do till I became such an officer myself. Learning that my\\ntrade was that of a calker, he promptly decided that the best place for\\nme was in New Bedford, Mass. He told me that many ships for whaling\\nvoyages were fitted out there, and that I might there find work at my\\ntrade and make a good living. So, on the day of the marriage ceremony,\\nwe took our little luggage to the steamer _John W. Richmond_, which, at\\nthat time, was one of the line running between New York and Newport, R.\\nI. Forty-three years ago colored travelers were not permitted in the\\ncabin, nor allowed abaft the paddle-wheels of a steam vessel. They were\\ncompelled, whatever the weather might be,—whether cold or hot, wet or\\ndry,—to spend the night on deck. Unjust as this regulation was, it did\\nnot trouble us much; we had fared much harder before. We arrived at\\nNewport the next morning, and soon after an old fashioned stage-coach,\\nwith “New Bedford” in large yellow letters on its sides, came down to\\nthe wharf. I had not money enough to pay our fare, and stood hesitating\\nwhat to do. Fortunately for us, there were two Quaker gentlemen who\\nwere about to take passage on the stage,—Friends William C. Taber and\\nJoseph Ricketson,—who at once discerned our true situation, and, in a\\npeculiarly quiet way, addressing me, Mr. Taber said: “Thee get in.” I\\nnever obeyed an order with more alacrity, and we were soon on our way\\nto our new home. When we reached “Stone Bridge” the passengers alighted\\nfor breakfast, and paid their fares to the driver. We took no\\nbreakfast, and, when asked for our fares, I told the driver I would\\nmake it right with him when we reached New Bedford. I expected some\\nobjection to this on his part, but he made none. When, however, we\\nreached New Bedford, he took our baggage, including three\\nmusic-books,—two of them collections by Dyer, and one by Shaw,—and held\\nthem until I was able to redeem them by paying to him the amount due\\nfor our rides. This was soon done, for Mr. Nathan Johnson not only\\nreceived me kindly and hospitably, but, on being informed about our\\nbaggage, at once loaned me the two dollars with which to square\\naccounts with the stage-driver. Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Johnson reached a\\ngood old age, and now rest from their labors. I am under many grateful\\nobligations to them. They not only “took me in when a stranger” and\\n“fed me when hungry,” but taught me how to make an honest living. Thus,\\nin a fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe in New\\nBedford, a citizen of the grand old commonwealth of Massachusetts.\\n\\nOnce initiated into my new life of freedom and assured by Mr. Johnson\\nthat I need not fear recapture in that city, a comparatively\\nunimportant question arose as to the name by which I should be known\\nthereafter in my new relation as a free man. The name given me by my\\ndear mother was no less pretentious and long than Frederick Augustus\\nWashington Bailey. I had, however, while living in Maryland, dispensed\\nwith the Augustus Washington, and retained only Frederick Bailey.\\nBetween Baltimore and New Bedford, the better to conceal myself from\\nthe slave-hunters, I had parted with Bailey and called myself Johnson;\\nbut in New Bedford I found that the Johnson family was already so\\nnumerous as to cause some confusion in distinguishing them, hence a\\nchange in this name seemed desirable. Nathan Johnson, mine host, placed\\ngreat emphasis upon this necessity, and wished me to allow him to\\nselect a name for me. I consented, and he called me by my present\\nname—the one by which I have been known for three and forty\\nyears—Frederick Douglass. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the “Lady\\nof the Lake,” and so pleased was he with its great character that he\\nwished me to bear his name. Since reading that charming poem myself, I\\nhave often thought that, considering the noble hospitality and manly\\ncharacter of Nathan Johnson—black man though he was—he, far more than\\nI, illustrated the virtues of the Douglas of Scotland. Sure am I that,\\nif any slave-catcher had entered his domicile with a view to my\\nrecapture, Johnson would have shown himself like him of the “stalwart\\nhand.”\\n\\nThe reader may be surprised at the impressions I had in some way\\nconceived of the social and material condition of the people at the\\nNorth. I had no proper idea of the wealth, refinement, enterprise, and\\nhigh civilization of this section of the country. My “Columbian\\nOrator,” almost my only book, had done nothing to enlighten me\\nconcerning Northern society. I had been taught that slavery was the\\nbottom fact of all wealth. With this foundation idea, I came naturally\\nto the conclusion that poverty must be the general condition of the\\npeople of the free States. In the country from which I came, a white\\nman holding no slaves was usually an ignorant and poverty-stricken man,\\nand men of this class were contemptuously called “poor white trash.”\\nHence I supposed that, since the non-slave-holders at the South were\\nignorant, poor, and degraded as a class, the non-slave-holders at the\\nNorth must be in a similar condition. I could have landed in no part of\\nthe United States where I should have found a more striking and\\ngratifying contrast, not only to life generally in the South, but in\\nthe condition of the colored people there, than in New Bedford. I was'}, {'chunk_id': 4, 'content': 'amazed when Mr. Johnson told me that there was nothing in the laws or\\nconstitution of Massachusetts that would prevent a colored man from\\nbeing governor of the State, if the people should see fit to elect him.\\nThere, too, the black man’s children attended the public schools with\\nthe white man’s children, and apparently without objection from any\\nquarter. To impress me with my security from recapture and return to\\nslavery, Mr. Johnson assured me that no slave-holder could take a slave\\nout of New Bedford; that there were men there who would lay down their\\nlives to save me from such a fate.\\n\\nThe fifth day after my arrival, I put on the clothes of a common\\nlaborer, and went upon the wharves in search of work. On my way down\\nUnion street I saw a large pile of coal in front of the house of Rev.\\nEphraim Peabody, the Unitarian minister. I went to the kitchen door and\\nasked the privilege of bringing in and putting away this coal. “What\\nwill you charge?” said the lady. “I will leave that to you, madam.”\\n“You may put it away,” she said. I was not long in accomplishing the\\njob, when the dear lady put into my hand _two silver half-dollars_. To\\nunderstand the emotion which swelled my heart as I clasped this money,\\nrealizing that I had no master who could take it from me,—_that it was\\nmine—that my hands were my own_, and could earn more of the precious\\ncoin,—one must have been in some sense himself a slave. My next job was\\nstowing a sloop at Uncle Gid. Howland’s wharf with a cargo of oil for\\nNew York. I was not only a freeman, but a free working-man, and no\\n“master” stood ready at the end of the week to seize my hard earnings.\\n\\nThe season was growing late and work was plenty. Ships were being\\nfitted out for whaling, and much wood was used in storing them. The\\nsawing this wood was considered a good job. With the help of old Friend\\nJohnson (blessings on his memory) I got a saw and “buck,” and went at\\nit. When I went into a store to buy a cord with which to brace up my\\nsaw in the frame, I asked for a “fip’s” worth of cord. The man behind\\nthe counter looked rather sharply at me, and said with equal sharpness,\\n“You don’t belong about here.” I was alarmed, and thought I had\\nbetrayed myself. A fip in Maryland was six and a quarter cents, called\\nfourpence in Massachusetts. But no harm came from the “fi’penny-bit”\\nblunder, and I confidently and cheerfully went to work with my saw and\\nbuck. It was new business to me, but I never did better work, or more\\nof it, in the same space of time on the plantation for Covey, the\\nnegro-breaker, than I did for myself in these earliest years of my\\nfreedom.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the just and humane sentiment of New Bedford three and\\nforty years ago, the place was not entirely free from race and color\\nprejudice. The good influence of the Roaches, Rodmans, Arnolds,\\nGrinnells, and Robesons did not pervade all classes of its people. The\\ntest of the real civilization of the community came when I applied for\\nwork at my trade, and then my repulse was emphatic and decisive. It so\\nhappened that Mr. Rodney French, a wealthy and enterprising citizen,\\ndistinguished as an anti-slavery man, was fitting out a vessel for a\\nwhaling voyage, upon which there was a heavy job of calking and\\ncoppering to be done. I had some skill in both branches, and applied to\\nMr. French for work. He, generous man that he was, told me he would\\nemploy me, and I might go at once to the vessel. I obeyed him, but upon\\nreaching the float-stage, where others [sic] calkers were at work, I\\nwas told that every white man would leave the ship, in her unfinished\\ncondition, if I struck a blow at my trade upon her. This uncivil,\\ninhuman, and selfish treatment was not so shocking and scandalous in my\\neyes at the time as it now appears to me. Slavery had inured me to\\nhardships that made ordinary trouble sit lightly upon me. Could I have\\nworked at my trade I could have earned two dollars a day, but as a\\ncommon laborer I received but one dollar. The difference was of great\\nimportance to me, but if I could not get two dollars, I was glad to get\\none; and so I went to work for Mr. French as a common laborer. The\\nconsciousness that I was free—no longer a slave—kept me cheerful under\\nthis, and many similar proscriptions, which I was destined to meet in\\nNew Bedford and elsewhere on the free soil of Massachusetts. For\\ninstance, though colored children attended the schools, and were\\ntreated kindly by their teachers, the New Bedford Lyceum refused, till\\nseveral years after my residence in that city, to allow any colored\\nperson to attend the lectures delivered in its hall. Not until such men\\nas Charles Sumner, Theodore Parker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Horace\\nMann refused to lecture in their course while there was such a\\nrestriction, was it abandoned.\\n\\nBecoming satisfied that I could not rely on my trade in New Bedford to\\ngive me a living, I prepared myself to do any kind of work that came to\\nhand. I sawed wood, shoveled coal, dug cellars, moved rubbish from back\\nyards, worked on the wharves, loaded and unloaded vessels, and scoured\\ntheir cabins.\\n\\nI afterward got steady work at the brass-foundry owned by Mr. Richmond.\\nMy duty here was to blow the bellows, swing the crane, and empty the\\nflasks in which castings were made; and at times this was hot and heavy\\nwork. The articles produced here were mostly for ship work, and in the\\nbusy season the foundry was in operation night and day. I have often\\nworked two nights and every working day of the week. My foreman, Mr.\\nCobb, was a good man, and more than once protected me from abuse that\\none or more of the hands was disposed to throw upon me. While in this\\nsituation I had little time for mental improvement. Hard work, night'}, {'chunk_id': 5, 'content': 'and day, over a furnace hot enough to keep the metal running like\\nwater, was more favorable to action than thought; yet here I often\\nnailed a newspaper to the post near my bellows, and read while I was\\nperforming the up and down motion of the heavy beam by which the\\nbellows was inflated and discharged. It was the pursuit of knowledge\\nunder difficulties, and I look back to it now, after so many years,\\nwith some complacency and a little wonder that I could have been so\\nearnest and persevering in any pursuit other than for my daily bread. I\\ncertainly saw nothing in the conduct of those around to inspire me with\\nsuch interest: they were all devoted exclusively to what their hands\\nfound to do. I am glad to be able to say that, during my engagement in\\nthis foundry, no complaint was ever made against me that I did not do\\nmy work, and do it well. The bellows which I worked by main strength\\nwas, after I left, moved by a steam-engine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDouglass, Frederick. “Reconstruction.”\\nAtlantic Monthly 18 (1866): 761-765.\\n\\nReconstruction\\n\\n\\nThe assembling of the Second Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress may\\nvery properly be made the occasion of a few earnest words on the\\nalready much-worn topic of reconstruction.\\n\\nSeldom has any legislative body been the subject of a solicitude more\\nintense, or of aspirations more sincere and ardent. There are the best\\nof reasons for this profound interest. Questions of vast moment, left\\nundecided by the last session of Congress, must be manfully grappled\\nwith by this. No political skirmishing will avail. The occasion demands\\nstatesmanship.\\n\\nWhether the tremendous war so heroically fought and so victoriously\\nended shall pass into history a miserable failure, barren of permanent\\nresults,—a scandalous and shocking waste of blood and treasure,—a\\nstrife for empire, as Earl Russell characterized it, of no value to\\nliberty or civilization,—an attempt to re-establish a Union by force,\\nwhich must be the merest mockery of a Union,—an effort to bring under\\nFederal authority States into which no loyal man from the North may\\nsafely enter, and to bring men into the national councils who\\ndeliberate with daggers and vote with revolvers, and who do not even\\nconceal their deadly hate of the country that conquered them; or\\nwhether, on the other hand, we shall, as the rightful reward of victory\\nover treason, have a solid nation, entirely delivered from all\\ncontradictions and social antagonisms, based upon loyalty, liberty, and\\nequality, must be determined one way or the other by the present\\nsession of Congress. The last session really did nothing which can be\\nconsidered final as to these questions. The Civil Rights Bill and the\\nFreedmen’s Bureau Bill and the proposed constitutional amendments, with\\nthe amendment already adopted and recognized as the law of the land, do\\nnot reach the difficulty, and cannot, unless the whole structure of the\\ngovernment is changed from a government by States to something like a\\ndespotic central government, with power to control even the municipal\\nregulations of States, and to make them conform to its own despotic\\nwill. While there remains such an idea as the right of each State to\\ncontrol its own local affairs,—an idea, by the way, more deeply rooted\\nin the minds of men of all sections of the country than perhaps any one\\nother political idea,—no general assertion of human rights can be of\\nany practical value. To change the character of the government at this\\npoint is neither possible nor desirable. All that is necessary to be\\ndone is to make the government consistent with itself, and render the\\nrights of the States compatible with the sacred rights of human nature.\\n\\nThe arm of the Federal government is long, but it is far too short to\\nprotect the rights of individuals in the interior of distant States.\\nThey must have the power to protect themselves, or they will go\\nunprotected, spite of all the laws the Federal government can put upon\\nthe national statute-book.\\n\\nSlavery, like all other great systems of wrong, founded in the depths\\nof human selfishness, and existing for ages, has not neglected its own\\nconservation. It has steadily exerted an influence upon all around it\\nfavorable to its own continuance. And to-day it is so strong that it\\ncould exist, not only without law, but even against law. Custom,\\nmanners, morals, religion, are all on its side everywhere in the South;\\nand when you add the ignorance and servility of the ex-slave to the\\nintelligence and accustomed authority of the master, you have the\\nconditions, not out of which slavery will again grow, but under which\\nit is impossible for the Federal government to wholly destroy it,\\nunless the Federal government be armed with despotic power, to blot out\\nState authority, and to station a Federal officer at every cross-road.\\nThis, of course, cannot be done, and ought not even if it could. The\\ntrue way and the easiest way is to make our government entirely\\nconsistent with itself, and give to every loyal citizen the elective\\nfranchise,—a right and power which will be ever present, and will form\\na wall of fire for his protection.\\n\\nOne of the invaluable compensations of the late Rebellion is the highly\\ninstructive disclosure it made of the true source of danger to\\nrepublican government. Whatever may be tolerated in monarchical and\\ndespotic governments, no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged\\nclass, or denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to\\nmaintain them. What was theory before the war has been made fact by the\\nwar.\\n\\nThere is cause to be thankful even for rebellion. It is an impressive\\nteacher, though a stern and terrible one. In both characters it has\\ncome to us, and it was perhaps needed in both.

That question, said he, was asked fifty years\\nago, and it has been answered by fifty years of unprecedented\\nprosperity. Spite of the eloquence of the earnest Abolitionists,—poured\\nout against slavery during thirty years,—even they must confess, that,\\nin all the probabilities of the case, that system of barbarism would\\nhave continued its horrors far beyond the limits of the nineteenth\\ncentury but for the Rebellion, and perhaps only have disappeared at\\nlast in a fiery conflict, even more fierce and bloody than that which\\nhas now been suppressed.\\n\\nIt is no disparagement to truth, that it can only prevail where reason\\nprevails. War begins where reason ends. The thing worse than rebellion\\nis the thing that causes rebellion. What that thing is, we have been\\ntaught to our cost. It remains now to be seen whether we have the\\nneeded courage to have that cause entirely removed from the Republic.\\nAt any rate, to this grand work of national regeneration and entire\\npurification Congress must now address Itself, with full purpose that\\nthe work shall this time be thoroughly done. The deadly upas, root and\\nbranch, leaf and fibre, body and sap, must be utterly destroyed. The\\ncountry is evidently not in a condition to listen patiently to pleas\\nfor postponement, however plausible, nor will it permit the\\nresponsibility to be shifted to other shoulders.

Truth shines with brighter light and\\nintenser heat at every moment, and a country torn and rent and bleeding\\nimplores relief from its distress and agony.\\n\\nIf time was at first needed, Congress has now had time. All the\\nrequisite materials from which to form an intelligent judgment are now\\nbefore it. Whether its members look at the origin, the progress, the\\ntermination of the war, or at the mockery of a peace now existing, they\\nwill find only one unbroken chain of argument in favor of a radical\\npolicy of reconstruction. For the omissions of the last session, some\\nexcuses may be allowed. A treacherous President stood in the way; and\\nit can be easily seen how reluctant good men might be to admit an\\napostasy which involved so much of baseness and ingratitude. It was\\nnatural that they should seek to save him by bending to him even when\\nhe leaned to the side of error. But all is changed now. Congress knows\\nnow that it must go on without his aid, and even against his\\nmachinations. The advantage of the present session over the last is\\nimmense. Where that investigated, this has the facts. Where that walked\\nby faith, this may walk by sight. Where that halted, this must go\\nforward, and where that failed, this must succeed, giving the country\\nwhole measures where that gave us half-measures, merely as a means of\\nsaving the elections in a few doubtful districts. That Congress saw\\nwhat was right, but distrusted the enlightenment of the loyal masses;\\nbut what was forborne in distrust of the people must now be done with a\\nfull knowledge that the people expect and require it. The members go to\\nWashington fresh from the inspiring presence of the people. In every\\nconsiderable public meeting, and in almost every conceivable way,\\nwhether at court-house, school-house, or cross-roads, in doors and out,\\nthe subject has been discussed, and the people have emphatically\\npronounced in favor of a radical policy. Listening to the doctrines of\\nexpediency and compromise with pity, impatience, and disgust, they have\\neverywhere broken into demonstrations of the wildest enthusiasm when a\\nbrave word has been spoken in favor of equal rights and impartial\\nsuffrage. Radicalism, so far from being odious, is not the popular\\npassport to power. The men most bitterly charged with it go to Congress\\nwith the largest majorities, while the timid and doubtful are sent by\\nlean majorities, or else left at home. The strange controversy between\\nthe President and the Congress, at one time so threatening, is disposed\\nof by the people. The high reconstructive powers which he so\\nconfidently, ostentatiously, and haughtily claimed, have been\\ndisallowed, denounced, and utterly repudiated; while those claimed by\\nCongress have been confirmed.\\n\\nOf the spirit and magnitude of the canvass nothing need be said. The\\nappeal was to the people, and the verdict was worthy of the tribunal.\\nUpon an occasion of his own selection, with the advice and approval of\\nhis astute Secretary, soon after the members of the Congress had\\nreturned to their constituents, the President quitted the executive'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'content': 'mansion, sandwiched himself between two recognized heroes,—men whom the\\nwhole country delighted to honor,—and, with all the advantage which\\nsuch company could give him, stumped the country from the Atlantic to\\nthe Mississippi, advocating everywhere his policy as against that of\\nCongress.

Unless reopened by the sword, as recklessly threatened in\\nsome circles, this question is now closed for all time.\\n\\nWithout attempting to settle here the metaphysical and somewhat\\ntheological question (about which so much has already been said and\\nwritten), whether once in the Union means always in the\\nUnion,—agreeably to the formula, Once in grace always in grace,—it is\\nobvious to common sense that the rebellious States stand to-day, in\\npoint of law, precisely where they stood when, exhausted, beaten,\\nconquered, they fell powerless at the feet of Federal authority. Their\\nState governments were overthrown, and the lives and property of the\\nleaders of the Rebellion were forfeited. In reconstructing the\\ninstitutions of these shattered and overthrown States, Congress should\\nbegin with a clean slate, and make clean work of it. Let there be no\\nhesitation. It would be a cowardly deference to a defeated and\\ntreacherous President, if any account were made of the illegitimate,\\none-sided, sham governments hurried into existence for a malign purpose\\nin the absence of Congress. These pretended governments, which were\\nnever submitted to the people, and from participation in which four\\nmillions of the loyal people were excluded by Presidential order,\\nshould now be treated according to their true character, as shams and\\nimpositions, and supplanted by true and legitimate governments, in the\\nformation of which loyal men, black and white, shall participate.\\n\\nIt is not, however, within the scope of this paper to point out the\\nprecise steps to be taken, and the means to be employed. The people are\\nless concerned about these than the grand end to be attained. They\\ndemand such a reconstruction as shall put an end to the present\\nanarchical state of things in the late rebellious States,—where\\nfrightful murders and wholesale massacres are perpetrated in the very\\npresence of Federal soldiers. This horrible business they require shall\\ncease. They want a reconstruction such as will protect loyal men, black\\nand white, in their persons and property; such a one as will cause\\nNorthern industry, Northern capital, and Northern civilization to flow\\ninto the South, and make a man from New England as much at home in\\nCarolina as elsewhere in the Republic. No Chinese wall can now be\\ntolerated. The South must be opened to the light of law and liberty,\\nand this session of Congress is relied upon to accomplish this\\nimportant work.\\n\\nThe plain, common-sense way of doing this work, as intimated at the\\nbeginning, is simply to establish in the South one law, one government,\\none administration of justice, one condition to the exercise of the\\nelective franchise, for men of all races and colors alike. This great\\nmeasure is sought as earnestly by loyal white men as by loyal blacks,\\nand is needed alike by both. Let sound political prescience but take\\nthe place of an unreasoning prejudice, and this will be done.\\n\\nMen denounce the negro for his prominence in this discussion; but it is\\nno fault of his that in peace as in war, that in conquering Rebel\\narmies as in reconstructing the rebellious States, the right of the\\nnegro is the true solution of our national troubles. The stern logic of\\nevents, which goes directly to the point, disdaining all concern for\\nthe color or features of men, has determined the interests of the\\ncountry as identical with and inseparable from those of the negro.\\n\\nThe policy that emancipated and armed the negro—now seen to have been\\nwise and proper by the dullest—was not certainly more sternly demanded\\nthan is now the policy of enfranchisement. If with the negro was\\nsuccess in war, and without him failure, so in peace it will be found\\nthat the nation must fall or flourish with the negro.\\n\\nFortunately, the Constitution of the United States knows no distinction\\nbetween citizens on account of color. Neither does it know any\\ndifference between a citizen of a State and a citizen of the United\\nStates. Citizenship evidently includes all the rights of citizens,\\nwhether State or national. If the Constitution knows none, it is\\nclearly no part of the duty of a Republican Congress now to institute\\none. The mistake of the last session was the attempt to do this very\\nthing, by a renunciation of its power to secure political rights to any\\nclass of citizens, with the obvious purpose to allow the rebellious\\nStates to disfranchise, if they should see fit, their colored citizens.\\nThis unfortunate blunder must now be retrieved, and the emasculated\\ncitizenship given to the negro supplanted by that contemplated in the\\nConstitution of the United States, which declares that the citizens of\\neach State shall enjoy all the rights and immunities of citizens of the\\nseveral States,—so that a legal voter in any State shall be a legal\\nvoter in all the States.'}], 'title': 'Collected Articles of Frederick Douglass', 'author': 'Frederick Douglass', 'language': 'English', 'release date': '1994-01-01', 'last modified date': '2022-06-27', 'summary': 'Frederick Douglass recounts his escape from slavery, relying on the help of others and false papers.

He emphasizes the need for action, such as putting people to work and reorganizing the use of natural resources, as well as the importance of unified relief activities and strict supervision of banking and investments.

The poems touch on experiences of looking at the horizon, being buried alive and experiencing renewal, mourning the loss of a loved one, reflecting on past experiences, and exploring various emotions and themes such as love, death, dreams, and indifference. Another poem expresses a dislike for cold weather and a fondness for warmth and coziness. The second text consists of six sonnets, each delving into different themes such as longing for lost love, memories of a departed loved one, and betrayal.","12":"Renascence, and Other
